Basic TZ Tracker for ROTW new timelines as a free CloudFlare worker. Has discord integrations and zone themes based banner message placeholders while no watched zone exist. Most zone controls are done via arrays so fairly simple to configure for server owners.

You'll need to setup some KVs, Discord Roles, set some secrets for WebHook etc in CloudFlare and Discord but it's completely free to run via CloudFlare. Request volumes are well under free tier limits. Have fun.
